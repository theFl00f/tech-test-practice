# Two Sum

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

##### Example:

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

##### Starting Function: 
```
const twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    
}

twoSum([2,7,11,15],9)
twoSum([0,0,3,13,100],0)
twoSum([-3,13,100,-100],10)
```
