# Move Zeroes

Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

##### Example:

```
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

##### Note:

1. You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
1. Minimize the total number of operations.

##### Starting Function:

```
const moveZeros = function(nums) {

}

moveZeroes([0,1,0,3,12])
moveZeroes([2,0,8,0,4,19,6,0,9])
```
